- Adds infrastructure like git, workflows and typescript
- Installs packages to simplify development, testing, deployment and more
- Provides clear scripts and instructions for tasks

## ðŸš€ Usage

```bash
cd /desired/location/for/package # Optional, can configure through terminal but this is quicker

npx make-npm-package

# All instructions will be provided in your terminal!
```
